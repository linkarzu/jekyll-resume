  ## Skills and interests:
    - I'm highly skilled and experienced in managing and deploying enterprise monitoring solutions, including the setup of integrations between monitoring tools for alerting and paging via PagerDuty or other paging tool
    - I like to dive deep into anything related to technology, not specific to a particular field.
    Whether it's Linux, networking, virtualization, containerization, cloud services, monitoring, web design, coding, you name it; 
    if it's something I can use in real life, I'm down for applying it.
    - I'm a huge Neovim fan, macOS is my daily driver, and Debian is my Linux distro of choice for servers.

  ## A bit more about me:
    - My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA certification, but I then soon realized that networking is just a small part of the landscape.
    - I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't know something, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something useful.
    - I love documenting my work, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress on a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll document the whole process in case I need to re-do it.
